# MuffinCDN
Super-rough-perhaps-shitty "CDN" intended only for OpenSB.

It will allow Qobo to use a second CDN for non-video "dynamic" files, perhaps improving the performance of the website.

While Qobo could just locally host its files, MuffinCDN could allow those files to be moved on another server if there's a storage issue.
